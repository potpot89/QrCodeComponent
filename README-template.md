## My process

1. in the head link all stylesheet.
   I always use 3 ayt least:

- reset.css to remove all standard paddings and margins;
- styles.css to add all my styles when building the projects;
- queries.css to put all @media-queries

2. start from the mobile version (we will make changes for the desktop version later, with the queries.css stylesheet);

3. In styles.css create the variables for colors and fonts;

4. Move the footer to the bottom with position: fixed and bottom: 0;

5. Make a div to store all content, set to width: 375px (mobile width);

6. Make the image fit in the div (width: 100%);

7. Center the text and add padding;

8. Set colors using the variables created at point 3;

9. Set all paddings and border-radius;

10. Center on the page with flexbox (create flex container with height set to 100vh)

11.Adjust media-queries for responsive design for desktop
